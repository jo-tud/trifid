This is an Ethereum Linked Data Browser. It can be used as a block explorer because EthOn based Ethereum data forms a graph with all of the data contained in the Ethereum Blockchain.

### Starting points
  - Start at a block: [Block 6,607,949](Block_6607949)
  - See the details of a transaction: [Tx with hash 0xb22730a30d93de87887654d6659b12bf520a5d074c078c86614d35df0189e68b](Tx_0xb22730a30d93de87887654d6659b12bf520a5d074c078c86614d35df0189e68b)
  - Look at a [log which is also a token transfer](LogEntry_0x3670360d3c3f20b1aea4c952faaa79e2e41b8e31e69797f91da0d82d1d79c69a_0)

### Direct navigation
You can directly navigation to Ethereum ressources.
  - Blocks: Block_ + block number
  - Tx: Tx_ + Tx hash

All Ethereum artifacts have such predictable URIs. Just browse a bit to get to know them.
